## Browsing or Buying? Predicting Online Shoppers' Purchasing Intention ðŸ›’ 

### Goal
The goal of this project is to predict whether an online shopper is likely to make a purchase during their session on an e-commerce website or not. Based on the assumption that a likely customer will make a purchase and bring in $100 revenue if offered a coupon, if the model predicts that a customer is likely to make a purchase (positive case), then the company will offer them a $5 coupon. Below is a confusion matrix illustrating the **dollar consequences** for the e-commerce client of scenarios in which the model predicts correctly and incorrectly.

_Note:_ Since the e-commerce company desires to increase its purchase conversion rate (the percentage of website visitors who purchased something from the online store over a period of time), the **interpretability** of the model, and determining which features influence an online shopper's likelihood to purchase, is a priority. Knowing these features, such as the month and pages associated with purchases, can guide how the company pushes promotions.

### Metric: F2
_Recall:_ TP / (TP + FN)

As shown, it is important for the company that we have a high recall (how many customers we predict are likely to purchase out of all likely customers). This is achieved by having more true positives and fewer false negatives. This will both maximize profit and minimize cost for the company.

_Precision:_ TP / (TP + FP)

While not as important as recall, precision (of all the customers we predict are likely to purchase, how many are likely customers) is still important. The true positive case brings in profit while false positives bring some lost profit to the company.

In order to capture both recall and precision, we will use F2 as our main metric, which places 2x importance on recall than precision.
